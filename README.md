# Akka Cluster Orchestration Example

This project is an example for [Lightbend Orchestration](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-orchestration-kubernetes/latest/).

This is a very simple [Akka Cluster](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/cluster-usage.html) and [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/) application. Its main purpose is to show how you can build a similar application and take advantage of the [Lightbend Orchestration](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-orchestration-kubernetes/latest/) to easily and deploy to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/) with minimal configuration required.

## Deployment

* [Kubernetes](KUBERNETES.md)
* [DC/OS](DCOS.md)
